### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites because it introduced the use of if/else chains when writing programs. It was like piecing a puzzle together with different pieces. It was a nice way to get comfortable with the concept and be introduced to what complex programs with branching outputs look like.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite of mine due to the objective of the lab. I was already aware of the rules to blackjack and how to calculate the value of your hand. I found it very interesting as to how you can implement it into a program using if statements and command line arguments as input.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was also a favorite of mine as it introduced object oriented programming with classes. I thought it was interesting to use classes to essentially create new data types that you determine the behavior and data for. While very intimidating at first, it was very rewarding and surprisingly straight forward when looking at the completed program.
